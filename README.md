# WardenStack: Modular, Opinionated, Decoupled.

A suite of focused libraries built for modern software development.

The philosophy is simple: Pick what you need, plug it in, and keep your core clean.

WardenStack is designed to respect the Dependency Inversion Principle. We provide lightweight Abstractions packages that you can safely reference in your Domain layer without polluting it with third-party dependencies. The Implementations are separate, allowing you to swap infrastructure or behavior without rewriting your business logic.

Core Principles:

    Modular by Design: No bloated monoliths. Install only the specific features you need.

    Domain-First: Use our Abstractions libraries to define contracts in your Core, and keep external dependencies in your Infrastructure.

    Standardized: Consistent naming, patterns, and behaviors across all packages.
